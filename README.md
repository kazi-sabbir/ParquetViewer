# Summary
This is a quick and dirty utility that I created to easily view Apache Parquet files on Windows desktop machines. 
The Parquet.NET library that does all the actual work is not heavily optimized so performance within this application
is far from ideal.

This application can only open Parquet files located on the Windows machine the app is running on. It cannot connect to HDFS to read parquet data. If you would like to add this feature please feel free to do so..

# Download
